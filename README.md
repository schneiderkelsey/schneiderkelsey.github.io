The Rain Garden/Wildflower webpage is a fun webpage to visit when you're on the go and at the plant shop without an idea of where to start on your own garden. Ideas come and go so why not try to create a webpage out of one. I have a garden that wont grow anything other than native plants. I also have a garden that tends to get a lot of rain when it's downpouring in Kentucky, so I've created a place where I can look up many native/water friendly plants. I had no clue there were so many Grasses/Sedges/Bushes, Small Trees and Shrubs, Ferns, and Wildflowers to choose from and for this project I've stuck to wildflowers because I love wildflowers. I also love art which is why I've included some of my favorite garden inspired photos to my webpage. I hope that when you visit this page you're inspired to start your own Wildflower Rain Garden. To quote Tom Petty, "You belong amoung the wildflowers". 
I started my webpage by completing mobile first, then desktop, then wide screen. I then added a Flexbox/CSS Grid combination. I included media queries to pull my webpage together. 
CSS Features List 
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. - I used a combination Flex and Grid. 
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon. 
JavaScript Features List 
Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. - Sometimes I don't care for looking at a list so I created a show/hide button for the wildflower plants. 


Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app.
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format.
Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams).
